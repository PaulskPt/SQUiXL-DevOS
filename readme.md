Hey, congratulations, you got yourself a SQUiXL!

This repository includes the (totally in development, forever to be evolving) full source for the included shipping firmware, which requires PlatformIO.

The shipping firmware is really a development demo that is used to add and test new features, and to offer those that want to design rich interactive applications a solid starting point that touches every aspect of what you can do with SQUiXL.

Maybe one day it wil turn into something more... maybe a full OS of sorts, but for now it's just a fun playground.
